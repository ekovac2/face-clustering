# Face clustering

The idea of this project is to show the implementation of a solution that would group people based on their similarities. 
Namely, there is an initial set of data (dataset) consisting of a certain number of images. 
Among these images there are similar and those that differ. As an output, groups of similar images are generated, 
and a special group includes images that are intruders, ie those images that the program has estimated to have no similarities with any other image. 
The implementation of the program is done in the Python programming language. Python has built-in facial recognition libraries that are installed and imported into the program.
